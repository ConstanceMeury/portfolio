        <h2>Evalmee</h2>
        <p>It's a remote <strong>examination platform</strong> who propose mainly QCM for now with <strong>security measures</strong> to avoid fraud. They have a teacher’s part who is well developed and permit them to set up quickly their examinations with many options. By now, they need to work on the student part and especially to build a new flow to support them.</p>

        <h2>Current experience</h2>
        <p>For now, they have a very <strong>short student flow</strong> who permits to pass the examination who begins with an initial e-mail, then an account creation, the examination, the result, and access to the correction.</p>

      <div class="container small-container">
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>I set up a questionnaire and interviews in order to know, in general and on Evalmee, the most important stress factors for the students, their relation to anti-fraud measures, to their environment. Their needs to be put in confidence, accompanied, and give credibility to these remote exams.</p>
        <p>The 300 answers to the survey and 5 interviews have shown, regarding our assumptions, that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>More than half have questions about the credibility of their score.</li>
        </ul>
        <figure align="center">
         <img src="../assets/images/evalmee/quote1.png" class="img-fluid align-center" alt="Responsive image">
        </figure>
        <ul>
          <li>Even if students are displeased by anti-fraud measures, only 30% are stressed by the use of their personal data and 93% of them understand supervision measures.</li>
        </ul>
        <figure align="center">
         <img src="../assets/images/evalmee/quote2.png" class="img-fluid align-center" alt="Responsive image">
        </figure>
        <p>If the main factor of stress is NOT supervision, then what is it?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>95% of them are stressed by digital tools dysfunction</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That’s why we have to know the <strong>students needs</strong> and validate or invalidate a crucial and controversial topic at a time of increasing distance working: <strong>student criticism of too intrusive anti-fraud measures</strong>.</p>

         <img src="../assets/images/evalmee/quote3.png" class="img-fluid align-center" alt="Responsive image">
        </figure>
        <p>More than eighty 80% of them expressed their need for practice and reminders on the tools and precautions to take during a remote examination.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="container small-container">
        <h2>Persona</h2>
        <p>Based on this research we were able to truly understand the needs and frustrations of our students and represent them through our persona: Alexia.</p>
        <p>Alexia is a young student who has already suffered technical issues with her computer.</p>
        <p>She is pain by these issues, the lack of reminders, lack of help, the recording of images in her private environment and she needs to have a studious environment, be reassured about digital tools, and to return her work despite technical issues.</p>
        <figure align="center">
         <img src="../assets/images/evalmee/persona.jpg" class="img-fluid align-center" alt="Responsive image">
         <figcaption class="text-center text-muted">Persona</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We have to reflect with her on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A way to make her prepared</li>
          <li>Be in confidence despite technical issues</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because she is nervous about difficulties with digital tools and she needs to be reassured on the becoming of scenes taken in her privacy.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="container small-container">
        <h2>User Journey Map</h2>
        <p>By doing Alexia’s journey map on the current website, we found that she is able to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Complete her examination with measures of security</li>
          <li>Access to the correction</li>
          <li>Have a technical support before and after the test</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        </figure>

        <div class="container small-container">
        <p>But she’s facing four major moments of doubt.</p>
        <ol>
         <li>When she receives the first e-mail a few days before the test with a link</li>
         <li>When she reads the instruction of the test on the platform</li>
         <li>Just before the test when she is searching for the connexion link</li>
         <li>When she discovers the error message when she tries to go out of the screen</li>
        </ol>

        </figure>

        <div class="container small-container">
          <h2>Looking for a solution</h2>
          <p>We study Evalmee’s main competitors to see how they give an answer to those matters.</p>
          <p>We find that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>All of them offer a very detailed user experience with instructions on the exam and anti-fraud measures.</li>
            <li>Most of them have internal methods for checking the correct functioning of the tools (webcam, audio, connection)</li>
            <li>One of them propose a declaration of honor to make students aware of their responsibilities regarding fraud</li>
            <li>None of them offer a modern and attractive design</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Evalmee wishes to position itself on an equal footing with its competitors and added this touch of modernity and closeness to students.</p>
          <p class="text-center"><FONT size="30pt">. . .</FONT></p>
          <p>Regarding those 4 majors pain point and what was proposed by competitors, we choose to work on the four most important part to support the students :</p>
          <ol>
            <li>We build a first visit with a tutorial</li>
            <li>We propose a complete dashboard with user’s guide and planning</li>
            <li>We have to send a reminder with the link the day of the exam</li>
            <li>We had to develop the last minutes preparations and technicals support during the exam</li>
          </ol>
          <p>New student flow:</p>
          </div>

          </figure>

       <div class="container small-container">
         <p>Now, with all this data, we can build our design.</p>
         <p>I started by making a low-fidelity then mid-fidelity prototype to place and organize all the information students need before thinking about colors and pictures.</p>
         <p>Usability tests and card sorting tests on seven people on mid-fi (and then high-fi) permit me to iterate on the wording, the menu, and mostly on how we organize the content.</p>
       </div>

       <div class="container small-container">
         <h2>Current design</h2>
         <p>I study the current design of the website and realize that he is made of two styles:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>A blue spirit with emoticons for the content and the logo</li>
           <li>A purple spirit with smooths drawings of peoples for the cover website</li>
         </ul>

       </figure>

       <div class="container small-container">
        <p>We needed to harmonize the both in accordance with the feeling Evalmee want to vehiculate.</p>
       </div>

       <div class="container small-container">
         <h2>Style tile</h2>
         <p>To make the website friendly and close to the students with professionalism, we decided to keep:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>The blue spirit around the logo and the content inside the current website</li>
           <li>The drawings and the explanation layout outside the current website</li>
         </ul>

         <div class="container small-container">
           <h2>Current design VS New design</h2>
           <p>The first contact between Evalmee and student is the first e-mail (left side of the picture). So I started by designing a new e-mail (right side) with drawings, call to action, and more information in clear dispositions.</p>

         <div class="container small-container">
           <p>Currently, the dashboard has few features (left side). I design a new one (right side) with a more personal design and all the new functionality to guide the students.</p>

         <div class="container small-container">
           <p>Currently, the student flow before an exam is very short with only one screen with the scale (left side). I have designed four screens with instructions and reminders. On the last one (right side) the student can sign a declaration on honor just before beginning the test to make him more responsible.</p>

           <h2>High-fidelity prototype</h2>
           <p>In this new flow, we receive the first e-mail a few days before examination with the most important instructions. We have to click on the link to access to the platform, create our account, and follow the tutorial with reminders and explanations on:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>Technical issues</li>

         <p>Through his website, Evalmee wants to vehiculate values of reliability, security, transparency, intelligence, and empathy.</p>
         <p>But the current design had feedback of impersonal, cold, confusing, and unclear experience.</p>
         <p>To know how this design is perceived we conduct 16 desirability tests.</p>
         <p>They shown that the new design is totally in adequation with their values with working, reliability, security, and intelligence feelings expressed by the users.</p>

        <p>To go further, we should test more the content on students to know if he permit to give them support and confidence.</p>
        <p>We should share learnings on remote examinations with teachers because we learn a lot about how they perceive the way to be evaluated.</p>
        <p>We also need to test and create the Evalmee Browser user flow.</p>
