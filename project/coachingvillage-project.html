        <p>Experimenting with remote services is becoming increasingly popular in many areas, whether it is for buying food, consulting doctors, maintaining our bodies… Many people want to rethink their job and provide their customers with different solutions.</p>
        <p>This is the case of Coaching Village.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container small-container">
        <h3>Coaching Village</h3>
        <p>Coaching Village is a fitness camp in Essaouira offering traineeship of varying lengths. They offer fitness, weight loss or weight gain in a community atmosphere where sharing and motivation are omnipresent.</p>

        <h3>Staff needs</h3>
        <p>They had been thinking for some time about proposing an application to participants to create a community, allow their clients to follow their physical measurements throughout their stay or propose exercises. My team and I, three Ux designers from Ironhack, were thinking about a wellness application and therefore proposed our services.</p>
        <p>We met them and they gave us their expectations and open-mindedness.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container small-container">
        <h3>Benchmarking VS Target</h3>
        <p>On our application stores, wellness tools abound, offering many features and ways to take care of your body and mind. We have explored many of them to understand what is out there and to see features that make them strong.</p>
        <p>The goal being to propose a digital solution to Coaching Village participants, we chose to meet seven of them, through job to be done interviews and proposed a survey to the community focusing on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Their relationship with sports and wellness applications</li>
          <li>Their relationship with Coaching Village and sport, on the spot and since their departure</li>
          <li>Their expectations in a Coaching Village application</li>
        </ul>
       </div>
       <div class="container small-container">
         <h3>Learnings</h3>
         <p>The participants expressed a really different need: they all wanted an application to better manage their return to real life!</p>
         <p>Their main frustration was the loss of motivation. After a couple of weeks, it became harder and harder for them to keep track of alone. But why?</p>

         <p>Let’s have a closer look at their journeys after the Bootcamp: we can see that former participants lost their motivation mainly due to lack of technical knowledge in sports exercises and nutrition which brings them to injuries and junk food.</p>

         <p>Our former coaching village participant needs a way to have planning and maintain her motivation at the same level as leaving Coaching Village by:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Exercising according to her capacities</li>
           <li>Learning to “replace snickers” with healthy food because she finally “has muscles and feels strong” in her head and in her body</li>

       <div class="container small-container">
         <h3>Ideation</h3>
         <p>At this stage of our design process, it was time for us to look for a solution!</p>

         <h2>Prototype High-fidelity</h2>
         <p>The design of the web site starts with a full-screen picture with a technical and mysterious feeling and only the main elements related to the event. Then comes in evidence the access to the virtual place and the three other usual pages on the physical show. We can also access the different pages through the menu.</p>
       </div>
       <figure align="center">
         <img src="../assets/images/euronaval/homedesktop.jpg" class="img-fluid " alt="Responsive image">

         <figcaption class="text-center text-muted">New design of the menu</figcaption>
       </figure>
       <div class="container small-container">
        <p>This event is dematerialized so I wanted to be detached from a traditional plan. On the virtual event home page, I use a sonar screen to access the listing of companies classified by sector (or by country or A-Z).</p>
        <p>We can still find a meeting room where meetings with recruiters and industrials will take place, the workshops, the schedule, the recruitment and orientation pole.</p>
        <figure align="center">
          <img src="../assets/images/euronaval/virtualhomepage.gif" class="img-fluid " alt="Responsive image">
          <figcaption class="text-center text-muted">Company selection on the virtual homepage</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>When we choose a company, we arrive on his personal page. Here we can:</p>

          <figcaption class="text-center text-muted">Company's virtual nteractions</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Usability tests permit me to iterate on the clarity of the menu and the virtual home page. It gives me the idea to create a logo for the virtual event in order to help the user to differentiate the physical from the virtual and return to the respective home pages easily.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container small-container">
        <h3>Responsive design</h3>
        <p>As you can see on those screens of the desktop and mobile version of the home page and the industrial page, the web site is made to be responsive and adapted to different screen sizes. On the home page, blocs of content are distributed according to the size of the screen and in the mobile version of the industrial page, we can choose to see more information and play with all the screen in landscape mode.</p>

            <h3>Desirability tests</h3>
            <p>To check the emotional response and desirability of my design, I conduct fourteen “reaction cards” test and six “5 secondes memory” tests.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>85% Technical</li>
              <li>70% Leader, sécurity and business</li>
              <li>60% Strong, harmonious, smart and dynamic</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These words show that the design of the web site reaches the goal and is in adequation with Euronaval’s attributes.</p>

           <h3>Learnings and next steps</h3>
           <p>I really liked having so much freedom in this one week project to experiment this design. It’s while researching for my Moodboard, browsing and browsing inspirations on the theme of the sea, new technologies, etc... that these colors and atmosphere came to me.</p>
           <p>Through design, you can turn a serious and professional subject into something exciting and captivating based on the right attributes.</p>
           <p>Don’t hesitate to play with the prototype of the virtual Euronaval exhibition! I will take your feedback with pleasure.</p>
