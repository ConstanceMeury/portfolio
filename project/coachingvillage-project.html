        <p>Experimenting with remote services is becoming increasingly popular in many areas, whether it is for buying food, consulting doctors, maintaining our bodies… Many people want to rethink their job and provide their customers with different solutions.</p>
        <p>This is the case of Coaching Village.</p>

      <div class="container small-container">
        <h3>Coaching Village</h3>
        <p>Coaching Village is a fitness camp in Essaouira offering traineeship of varying lengths. They offer fitness, weight loss or weight gain in a community atmosphere where sharing and motivation are omnipresent.</p>

        <h3>Staff needs</h3>
        <p>They had been thinking for some time about proposing an application to participants to create a community, allow their clients to follow their physical measurements throughout their stay or propose exercises. My team and I, three Ux designers from Ironhack, were thinking about a wellness application and therefore proposed our services.</p>
        <p>We met them and they gave us their expectations and open-mindedness.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container small-container">
        <h3>Benchmarking VS Target</h3>
        <p>On our application stores, wellness tools abound, offering many features and ways to take care of your body and mind. We have explored many of them to understand what is out there and to see features that make them strong.</p>
        <p>The goal being to propose a digital solution to Coaching Village participants, we chose to meet seven of them, through job to be done interviews and proposed a survey to the community focusing on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Their relationship with sports and wellness applications</li>
          <li>Their relationship with Coaching Village and sport, on the spot and since their departure</li>
          <li>Their expectations in a Coaching Village application</li>
        </ul>
       </div>
       <div class="container small-container">
         <h3>Learnings</h3>
         <p>The participants expressed a really different need: they all wanted an application to better manage their return to real life!</p>
         <p>Their main frustration was the loss of motivation. After a couple of weeks, it became harder and harder for them to keep track of alone. But why?</p>

       <div class="container small-container">
         <p>Let’s have a closer look at their journeys after the Bootcamp: we can see that former participants lost their motivation mainly due to lack of technical knowledge in sports exercises and nutrition which brings them to injuries and junk food.</p>

       <div class="container small-container">
         <p>Our former coaching village participant needs a way to have planning and maintain her motivation at the same level as leaving Coaching Village by:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Exercising according to her capacities</li>
           <li>Learning to “replace snickers” with healthy food because she finally “has muscles and feels strong” in her head and in her body</li>
         </ul>
       </div>
       <div class="container small-container">
         <h3>Ideation</h3>
         <p>At this stage of our design process, it was time for us to look for a solution!</p>
         <p>Several great design opportunities came to surface thanks to Worst Idea & Round Robin tools.</p>
