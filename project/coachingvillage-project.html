        <p>Experimenting with remote services is becoming increasingly popular in many areas, whether it is for buying food, consulting doctors, maintaining our bodies… Many people want to rethink their job and provide their customers with different solutions.</p>
        <p>This is the case of Coaching Village.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container small-container">
        <h2>Coaching Village</h2>
        <p>Coaching Village is a fitness camp in Essaouira offering traineeship of varying lengths. They offer fitness, weight loss or weight gain in a community atmosphere where sharing and motivation are omnipresent.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>5OO participants since 2018</li>
          <li>70% are women</li>
          <li>80% want to lose weight</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="container small-container">
        <h2>Staff needs</h2>
        <p>They had been thinking for some time about proposing an application to participants to create a community, allow their clients to follow their physical measurements throughout their stay or propose exercises. My team and I, three Ux designers from Ironhack, were thinking about a wellness application and therefore proposed our services.</p>
        <p>We met them and they gave us their expectations and open-mindedness.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container small-container">
        <h2>Benchmarking VS Target</h2>
        <p>On our application stores, wellness tools abound, offering many features and ways to take care of your body and mind. We have explored many of them to understand what is out there and to see features that make them strong.</p>
        <p>The goal being to propose a digital solution to Coaching Village participants, we chose to meet seven of them, through job to be done interviews and proposed a survey to the community focusing on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Their relationship with sports and wellness applications</li>
          <li>Their relationship with Coaching Village and sport, on the spot and since their departure</li>
          <li>Their expectations in a Coaching Village application</li>
        </ul>
       </div>
       <div class="container small-container">
         <h2>Learnings</h2>
         <p>The participants expressed a really different need: they all wanted an application to better manage their return to real life!</p>
         <p>Their main frustration was the loss of motivation. After a couple of weeks, it became harder and harder for them to keep track of alone. But why?</p>

       <div class="container small-container">
         <p>Let’s have a closer look at their journeys after the Bootcamp: we can see that former participants lost their motivation mainly due to lack of technical knowledge in sports exercises and nutrition which brings them to injuries and junk food.</p>

       <div class="container small-container">
         <p>Our former coaching village participant needs a way to have planning and maintain her motivation at the same level as leaving Coaching Village by:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Exercising according to her capacities</li>
           <li>Learning to “replace snickers” with healthy food because she finally “has muscles and feels strong” in her head and in her body</li>

         <h2>Ideation</h2>
         <p>At this stage of our design process, it was time for us to look for a solution!</p>
         <p>Several great design opportunities came to surface thanks to Worst Idea & Round Robin tools.</p>
         <p>Throughout all our creative processes, we had the chance to have our ideas evaluated by participants during interviews using a couple of tools as the Moscow method. We work hard on the features prioritization to get fast and be focus on a minimum viable product.</p>
         <p>As you can see on this storyboard, participants will have access to daily support with sports and nutritional exercises plus a community with challenges.</p>

         <h2>Prototype low-fi to mid-fi</h2>
         <p>We started to sketch our low-fi prototype directly in Invision, which is a fantastic collaborative tool when you are remote. It allowed us to quickly test our ideas, iterate to finally come up with our mid-fi prototype on Figma.</p>

        <h2>Moodbard</h2>
        <p>The next step for us was to get the right “mood” for the App regarding the attribute of Coaching Village.</p>

      <div class="container small-container">
        <p>We wanted to convey more the motivating, healthy and sportive atmosphere of Coaching Village in our Moodboard:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Geometrical pattern to suggest the sportive spirit</li>
          <li>Powerful pictures</li>
          <li>“Limits” painted with a brush to remind us that we should exceed your limits</li>

      <div class="container small-container">
        <h2>Style tile</h2>
        <p>For our style tile, we used orange as a primary color. This combination of the power of red and the friendliness of yellow brings a feeling of motivation and enthusiasm. We these colorful elements in a grey and white atmosphere with angular shapes to push the sportive side.</p>
        <p>We balanced it with some little touch of green for specific elements to have a more positive and healthy feeling to get further in Coaching Village identity.</p>

      <div class="container small-container">
        <p>For the typography, Open Sans was a natural choice as we wanted a discreet typeface to balance with the brushy typeface of our pictures.</p>

        <h2>Usability test & iterations</h2>
        <p>We conduct some tests to improve our Userflow and the hierarchy of the information. The different phases of iteration permit us to have a product more appealing and closer to the spirit convey by Coaching Village that is real and motivating. There is some example of iterations.</p>
      </div>

        <div class="container small-container">
        <h3>Iteration 1</h3>
        <p>In our first version (first screen) we choose pulsating images taken by professionals. But, during the tests everybody was missing the joyful faces of Coaching Village participants. That is why we decided to use only pictures taken at Coaching Village (second screen).</p>
        <figure align="center">

        </figure>
        <p>At the top of the first screen you can see three green dots who are gauge showing the state of the user’s constants: We replace it with a full bar for more clarity.</p>
        <h3>Iteration 2</h3>
        <p>The first version of our design was made around the grid in orange and the buttons were discreet. We reduce the omnipresence of the grid and highlight buttons for a better hierarchy information.</p>
        <figure align="center">

        </figure>
        <h3>Iteration 3</h3>
        <p>Then, We redesigned the access to the community sections in a similar way to the home page for more consistency. We also change the footer menu to have a design without roundness, closer to the general spirit.</p>

            <p>Through this two week project, it was really interesting to Design the app as close as the coaching village experience and to work on a graphism more concentrated on the sport side that the sunny side of This fitness camp.</p>
            <p>Afterward, we wish to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Design all the features (account, recipes, …)</li>
              <li>Move to development with coaching village team</li>
              <li>Change the pictures of the app by organizing a dedicated shooting with all the teams of Coaching Village</li>
              <li>Add videos “Let’s cook with Coaching Village chief!” to encourage people to cook their meals properly without processed products</li>
